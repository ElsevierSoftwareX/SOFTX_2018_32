# Json-gui

Json-gui is an angular front-end module that dynamically generates a full-featured form-based web interface, including validation and constraints.
Starting from a formal JSON configuration describing a list of inputs (that can be a select, a text or integer input or other types), this module is able to build a form frame interface, with standard type - but also personalized - validation, also giving the possibility to define any constraint between inputs. 

# Installation

# Usage

Two different usages are possible:
.1. using the whole json-gui component
.2. using single components for declaring single input fields.
